### Mini Ultimatum Game

In this game, you will take on one of three roles:

- **Player 1:** 1. Endowed with Ksh 200 and  Is asked to send some money out of the 200 to Player 2.
- **Player 2:** Waits for Player 1 to send him some Money
- **Player 3 (the Punisher):** 
    -   1. Waits for Player 1 to make an offer to Player 2
    -   2. Before the money reaches Player 2, he sees how much it is.
    -   3. Depending on how he feels about the amount, he can do 2 things
-   a. Punish - If he feels the money that Player 1 has sent to Player 2 is not a fair
    amount, he will choose to punish Player 1. If this happens, then both Player 1
    and Player 2 will not receive any payout.

-        b. Not Punish - If he feels that the amount that Player 1 sends to Player 2 is fair,
    then he will choose this option. If this happens, both Player 1 and Player 2 will
    receive payouts. Payout will be calculated this way:
-     i. Player 1 Payout = 200 - Amount sent to Player 2
-     ii. Player 2 Payout = Amount sent by Player
